This is the 'about' file of this project.<br/>



<br/>
<b>ATTENTION !!!</b> <em>Risk of disk flooding!</em>
Please make sure to disable XDEBUG Profiler for large projects.<br/>
The tool makes many and often looped method calls leading to hude cachegrind files in your tmp folder.<br/>
For example just building doc for Zend Framework produces a 2GB cachegrind file.<br/>
Just parsing all files results in 400MB less memory on your disk.<br/>
Now imagine a cron job that does this every day. Or twice! :D ... go get it.<br/>
<br/>
The profiler also slows this tool down by more than 100%.<br/>
